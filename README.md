We provide for the Computer Vision project two separate files into initial script folder:

- split_data.py: it separates data into train/validation/test sets
- tf_records.py: it reads the csv files extracted from the previous script to create tensorflow records

The comet dataset is provided privately by mail upon request.

Moreover, a brief literature overview is provided into bibliography folder to introduce some Deep Learning techniques:

- Deep Learning techniques applied to comet assays
- Bounding box segmentation methodologies
